# Numerical Simulation and Data Analysis of a Physical System

Numerical simulation and data analysis of a physical system using Python and scientific computing tools.

## 📌 Description
This project focuses on the numerical modeling and analysis of a physical system.
Mathematical models are implemented and solved using numerical methods, and the resulting data are processed and visualized to extract meaningful physical insights.

The objective is to demonstrate the use of scientific programming techniques for simulation, data analysis, and result interpretation.

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## 📊 Methodology
- Definition of the physical model
- Numerical solution using appropriate algorithms
- Data processing and statistical analysis
- Visualization of results through plots and figures

## 📈 Results
The simulations provide quantitative insight into the behavior of the system under different conditions.
Key results are presented through plots, which can be found in the `figures/` directory.

## ▶️ How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```
